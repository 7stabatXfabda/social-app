In this article, we will show you how to use CATT3 full version for some common thermodynamic calculations. We will use the following example problem as a guide:
  
Example: A steam power plant operates with a boiler pressure of 15 MPa and a condenser pressure of 10 kPa. The steam enters the turbine at 600Â°C and leaves at 90% quality. The mass flow rate of steam is 120 kg/s. Determine the following:

1. The net power output of the plant
2. The thermal efficiency of the plant
3. The heat transfer rate in the boiler and the condenser
4. The entropy generation rate in the plant

To solve this problem, we will use CATT3 full version to calculate the thermodynamic properties of steam at various states and perform the energy and entropy balances for the plant. We will also use CATT3 full version to plot the T-s diagram and the P-h diagram for the plant.
  
The first step is to launch CATT3 full version and select "Steam" as the working fluid from the drop-down menu. Then, we can enter the given data in the input fields and click on "Calculate" to obtain the properties of steam at state 1 (boiler exit) and state 2 (turbine exit).
  
The results are shown in the table below:

| State | Pressure (MPa) | Temperature (Â°C) | Specific enthalpy (kJ/kg) | Specific entropy (kJ/kg-K) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 1 | 15 | 600 | 3515.9 | 6.7428 |

| 2 | 0.01 | - | 2163.8 | 7.6715 |

We can also use CATT3 full version to plot the T-s diagram and the P-h diagram for the plant by clicking on "Plot" and selecting the desired variables. The diagrams are shown below:

To calculate the net power output of the plant, we need to apply the energy balance for the turbine and the pump:
  
W<sub>turbine</sub> = m(h<sub>1</sub> - h<sub>2</sub>) = 120(3515.9 - 2163.8) = 162.7 MW
  
W<sub>pump</sub> = m(h<sub>4</sub> - h<sub>3</sub>) â m(v<sub>f,3</sub>(P<sub>4</sub> - P<sub>3</sub>) = 120(0.00101)(15 - 0.01) = 0.2 MW
  
W<sub>net</sub> = W<sub>turbine</sub> - W<sub>pump</sub> = 162.7 - 0.2 = 162.5 MW
  
To calculate the thermal efficiency of the plant, we need to apply the energy balance for the boiler and the condenser:
  
Q<sub>in</sub> = m(h<sub>1</sub> - h<sub>f,4</sub>) = 120(3515.9 - 908.8) = 313.7 MW
  
Q<sub>out</sub> = m(h<sub>f,2</sub> - h<sub>f,3</sub>) = 120(191.8 - 191.8) = 0 MW
  
η = W<sub>net</sub>/Q<sub>in</sub> = 162.5/313.7 = 0.518 or 51.8%
  
To calculate the heat transfer rate in the boiler and the condenser, we can use the same equations as above:
